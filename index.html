Often the best poems are written from the heart, raw, emotional and to the point. Poem favors brevity, yet the best poems also capture a great amount of detail, making them incredibly powerful to their readers. However, this makes poetry often difficult to fully understand due to its unique literature structure.<br><br><em>Can we quantify expression in poetry through methods like extracting high frequency word, such as love, fears, suffering, burning, and death in Shakespeare's poetry, or do we need more insights such as NLP / Sentiment Analysis to be able to understand the intention behind the poets' careful creation?</em>

            <p>Sentiment analysis in Natural Language Processing (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the use of NLP text analysi and computational linguistics to systematically extract, quantify, and identify affective states and subjective information in a text sample.

The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon includes a list of more than 20,000 English words and their valence, arousal, and dominance scores. For a given word and a dimension (V/A/D), the scores range from 0 (lowest V/A/D) to 1 (highest V/A/D). The lexicon with its fine-grained real-valued scores was created by manual annotation using Best--Worst Scaling. <em><br><br>valence is the positive--negative or pleasure--displeasure dimension;<br>arousal is the excited--calm or active--passive dimension;<br>and dominance is the powerful--weak or 'have full control'--'have no control' dimension.</em></p>

                It is quite interesting to see that modern poetry seems to have more distinctive sentiment characteristics, yet the general recognized sentiment are always around the mid-range. From this, we can make some assumptions, like modern poetry may be more personalized than earlier (Renaissance) poetry with specific rhythmic guidelines, given things like increasing poetry written in the free verse format.

            The classification of emotional states from poetry has not been receiving enough attention in the NLP world given its flexible connection to traditional grammatical structure. However, with the emotional analysis, we may be able to understand more regarding author's intent for expression through this method.<br><br><em>Given the poems subject matter, how do poems make you feel?<br>Could it change the way you used to interpret poetry?<br>Does this additional aspect of understanding give you a new perspective to poetry, or perhaps motivation to write and analyze your own?</em><br><br>I have created a draft Sentiment Analyzer that allows you to input text-drafts and build visualizations based on your creation.
